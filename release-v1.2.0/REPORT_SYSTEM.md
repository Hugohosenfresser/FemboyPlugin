### üîó Option 2: Webhook Setup (Legacy)

For basic Discord reporting without a bot:

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Right-click on the channel where you want to receive reports
3. Select "Edit Channel" > "Integrations" > "Webhooks" > "New Webhook"
4. Copy the webhook URL
5. Edit `plugins/FemboyPlugin/config.yml` and replace `CHANGE_ME` with your webhook URL

### 2. Configuration Options

Edit `config.yml` to customize the report system:

```yaml
# Permissions system
permissions:
  givecustomitem: "femboyplugin.givecustomitem"
  givegui: "femboyplugin.givegui"
  report: "femboyplugin.report"
  commands: "femboyplugin.commands"
  admin: "femboyplugin.admin"
  no_permission: "&cYou don't have permission to use this command!"

discord:
  webhook_url: "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"
  bot_name: "Server Reports"
  bot_avatar: "https://i.imgur.com/4M34hi2.png"

reports:
  cooldown_seconds: 300      # 5 minutes between reports
  max_message_length: 500    # Maximum characters in a report
  log_to_console: true       # Log reports to server console
  store_locally: true        # Store reports in reports.yml

messages:
  report_sent: "&aYour report has been sent to the staff team!"
  cooldown: "&cYou must wait %time% seconds before sending another report."
  # ... (other customizable messages)
```

## File Storage

When `store_locally` is enabled, reports are saved in `plugins/FemboyPlugin/reports.yml`:

```yaml
reports:
  RPT-1234567890123:
    type: PLAYER
    reporter: PlayerName
    content: "Reported Player: BadPlayer | Reason: griefing"
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:45"
    status: OPEN
```

## Permissions

The report system uses a configurable permission system:

### Report Command Permissions:
- **Default**: `femboyplugin.report` (everyone by default)
- **Configurable**: Can be changed or disabled in config.yml

### Permission Configuration:
```yaml
permissions:
  report: "femboyplugin.report"     # Require this permission
  report: "custom.report.use"       # Use custom permission
  report: ""                        # Disable permission check (allow everyone)
  no_permission: "&cNo permission!" # Custom no-permission message
```

### Discord Bot Management ü§ñ
**New in v1.2.0** - Admin commands for managing Discord report logging:

```bash
# Check Discord bot status and report delivery
/discord status

# Test report channel connectivity
/discord test reports

# Toggle report logging on/off
/discord toggle reports

# View current event logging settings
/discord events

# Reload Discord configuration
/discord reload
```

**Required Permission**: `femboyplugin.discord` (op only)

### Permission Plugin Integration:
You can use any permission plugin (LuckPerms, PermissionsEx, etc.) to manage access:

```yaml
# Grant report permission to a group
lp group default permission set femboyplugin.report true

# Grant Discord admin permission
lp group admin permission set femboyplugin.discord true

# Deny permission to a specific player
lp user BadPlayer permission set femboyplugin.report false
```

## Error Handling

The system handles various error conditions:
- Invalid webhook URLs
- Network connectivity issues
- Rate limiting
- Malformed reports
- Cooldown violations

All errors are logged to the server console for debugging.

## üîß Troubleshooting
